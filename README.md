# shareID
apetureShare uses a system developed by me called shareIDV2. a shareIDV2 is a key to accses a file it works by taking a magnet URL use DEFLATE compression to make it smaller then base64 encode it the final product is a small string of letters and numbers much more efficient then a magnet url
