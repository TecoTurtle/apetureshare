# apetureShare
this is apetureShare (yes the name is a portal reference)
apetureShare uses torrents to send files using p2p we dont use any servers because your computer IS the server
idc what you send piracy is fine heck nsfw is fine
# how it works
apetureShare is basically webtorrent DEFLATE and base64 duct taped together you can upload a file and then share the shareID another user can use that shareID to download the file as long as the uploader keeps the tab open it does this by using webtorrent and making the uploader a seeder
